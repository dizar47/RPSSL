<h4>The Main page implemented as a Razor page with JS for fetching data from the RESTful API.</h4>
<p>GameServiceController</p>
<ul>
<li><b>GET</b> /choice</li>
<li><b>GET</b> /choices</li>
<li><b>POST</b> /play</li>
</ul>
<p>For ease of use it was decided to wrap suggested API reponse formats in the API Response class.</p>
<h4>The Leaderboard page was built as a regular Razor page.</h4>
